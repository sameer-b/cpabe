Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption


This software is a Java realization for "ciphertext-policy attribute based
encryption" (CP-ABE).

To use this software, you will need to have the Java Pairing Based Cryptography
Library(jPBC) installed (jpbc-1.2.0 is tested). You can get it from the
following page:

   http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/

For more information on CP-ABE and a tutorial on using the tools, see
the project homepage:

Your mush be responsible for the problem caused by using the code.

I stop developping this package since July, 2012. A lot of issues are in this
implementation. Feel free to contribute to and imporve this project since
someone else may come across the same issue as you.
